# Product Reviews

This website is created for computer components' user experience disclosure. There are so many advertisements and sponsorships today and this makes it harder to find what is worth buying even when we try to search about the user experience of the products we want to buy, it's hard to find because of the sponsorships. This website is dedicated to not having sponsorships or getting ads. Our passion is to compare and find the best user experience and share it with everyone.

## Testing

  - I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good, and functions on all standard screen sizes using the dev tools device toolbar.

  - I confirmed that the sign-up form works: requires only an email and a name and the sign-up button for submitting works.
  - I also used the lighthouse devtool test and here are the results for mobile and desktop lighthouse tests:

## Credits

### Content

 The code to make the Sign-Up form was taken from the "https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev".But I made too many changes to it.

### Media 

- I took the monitor testing hero image  and the keyboard image from [rtings](https://www.rtings.com/)
- I took the monitor image from [lg.com](https://www.lg.com/de/monitore/lg-38gn950-b)

## Inspirations and technical research: 

* [Mouse-TechLead](https://www.youtube.com/@TechLead)
* [Keyboard-rtings](https://www.rtings.com/)
* [Monitor-BijanJamshidi](https://www.youtube.com/@BijanJamshidi)

## Sources I got inspired by and got help:

I used these sources as a source to learn.I didn't use any of the code sources completely. I tried to learn by watching and then when I became able to use the codes consciously, these sources turned into a default layout for me.
