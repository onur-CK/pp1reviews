# Product Reviews

This website is created for computer components' user experience disclosure. There are so many advertisements and sponsorships today and this makes it harder to find what is worth buying even when we try to search about the user experience of the products we want to buy, it's hard to find because of the sponsorships. This website is dedicated to not having sponsorships or getting ads. Our passion is to compare and find the best user experience and share it with everyone.

# Sources I got inspired by and got help:
- I used these sources as a source to learn I didn't use any of the code sources completely. I tried to learn by watching and learning and then when I became able to use the codes consciously. These sources turned into a default layout for me.
