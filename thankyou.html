                <h2>Monitor: LG 38GN850-B</h2>
                <p>
                    The LG 38GN950-B is good for office use. It has a large 38 inch ultrawide screen that gives you plenty of space to open multiple windows side-by-side, and its high pixel density results in sharp images and text. Its reflection handling is just okay, but the screen gets pretty bright, so you shouldn't have any visibility issue in most settings. The stand doesn't swivel at all, which isn't ideal if you need to turn the screen to share your work with a coworker. On the upside, it has good viewing angles, so the image remains accurate at the sides when you sit up close and when viewing from the side. 
                    The LG 38GN950-B is good for media consumption. It has a large, high-resolution screen that feels incredibly immersive. It doesn't handle reflections all that well, but it gets bright enough to combat glare in most lighting conditions. The viewing angles are good, so the image remains fairly accurate when viewed from the side, great for sharing content with others. Sadly, the ergonomics are somewhat limited because it doesn't swivel at all, and its sub-par contrast ratio isn't ideal for dark rooms.
                    The LG 38GN950-B is great for content creation. Its 38 inch ultrawide format is amazing for video editors working on a timeline, and its high pixel density lets you see all the fine details of your work clearly. It has full sRGB coverage, superb gradient handling, and no color bleed. The stand doesn't allow for swivel adjustment, which makes it harder to turn the screen when you need to show your work to clients and colleagues. On the upside, the viewing angles are good, so the image remains accurate when viewed from the side.

                Mouse: Razer Basilisk v3 pro
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although not designed for this use, the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is an excellent office mouse. The right-handed ergonomic shape is very comfortable to use, and the mouse feels overall very well-built in hand. Notably, its scroll wheel has quite a bit of features, including two free-scrolling modes and left-right tilt inputs, making it a great choice if you tend to work with video editing or spreadsheets. There's also a cluster of three buttons on the left side, and all buttons on the mouse are re-programmable using the companion software. You can connect the mouse with two devices simultaneously: one with its USB receiver and another with a Bluetooth connection.
                The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro is an excellent mouse for FPS gaming. It has exceptionally low click latency for a very responsive-feeling in-game experience. The right-handed ergonomic shape is comfortable to use, though it's best suited for larger hands. Overall, it feels very well-built and has high-quality feet that provide an excellent gliding experience on desks and mousepads. However, it's heavy compared to dedicated FPS gaming mice, meaning you may prefer a lighter option.
